# Beef Bourguignon

I've been making this for several years now. Always a crowd favorite and worth the effort to do right. This is adapted from Julia Child's classic Boeuf Bourguignon, I lightened it up by removing bacon, changing up the wine, adding cognac and a few other things. In my opinion, the flavors in this version are more distinct. It is a *beef forward* recipe.

## Notes

* As always, use the highest quality ingredients you can find

* This recipe calls for a lot of alcohol, don't cook with anything that you (or someone else) would not willingly drink. Also since there is always 

* Buy whole prime chuck. Do not substitute for lower quality cuts or butcher stew meat or, its trash

* Canned beef stock is universally bad. Avoid if at all possible, but if you can't [make your own](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2018/11/pressure-cooker-beef-stock.html) then check your local high-end grocery store. Some stores will make their own stocks and offer them for sale either frozen or fresh

A last resort is to use canned low sodium stock (**not broth**) but add [Demi-Glace](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=demi+glace&ref=nb_sb_noss) to boost beef flavor.

* It is tempting to combine steps and make this all at once. Please do not skip any steps, you'll end up with a murky boring gravy like stew

* This dish gets better the longer it sits so I always make it at least a day in advance

* Serves about 6
