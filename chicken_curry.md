# Chicken Curry

This is a basic chicken curry recipie. It can be easily adapated to other protiens or as a base for more complicated dishes.

## Notes

If at all possible use whole spices and [tost and grind](https://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/how-to-toast-spices-slideshow.html) them prior to making the curry.

If you don't want to do it *the right way* then store bought stuff works ok, try at least to use quality spices that are usually obtainable from asian grocery stores.

I prefer to use bone-in dark meat for this but any type of chicken will work. An white meat only variant might benefit from a neutral chicken stock.

Heat levels are all about the chili powder and how the jalapenos are prepped, see prep notes.

Serves about 4 and goes well with [Daal](./daal.md)

## Ingredients

* dozen chicken legs
* 1tbs chili powder
* 1tbs cumin
* 2tbs corriander
* 1/3 tbs turmeric
* 3/4 tbs salt
* 1/4 tbs mustard seeds
* a few curry leaves
* 4 jalapenos
* two tomatoes
* one onion
* Basmati or jasmine rice

## Prep

* Remove skin from chicken
* Onion - cut into slices, I prefer to make very thin slices
* Tomatos - Cut into wedges, at least quarter
* jalapenos - slice lengthwise, I prefer thin slices of about 1/4 or thinner. Remove seeds but leave seed ribs

## Cook

* Put a large pot on medium heat
* Sweat the onion
* Once onion is starting to cook put everything else into the pot  
add some water, enough to cover chicken
* Bring water to above simmer but not full on boil
* Cover with lid
* stir occasionally
* Cook at least for 45 minutes

### Cooking notes

You want to keep enough water in the pot to cook everything, add more if its boiling off faster than desired.

However, in the end you want to have a thicker sauce. So after you've cooked the chicken, reduce the liquid until it coats back of a spoon. You do not need to remove anything from the pot during this time.

Add salt to taste during the reduction stage.

Cook your rice which ever way you like, I use a plain old rice cooker
