# Daal

Daal can be served on its own but I usually make it to go with [other](./chicken_curry.md) mains. 

This is a basic recipe that can be adapted to many other variants of daal, which are distinguished by consistency (soup-like or paste) or by types of lentils used.

## Ingredients

* handful of dried chilli peppers
* two medium onions
* 1 tbs curry powder
* 1/2 tbs salt
* 2 cups of yellow split peas
* Optional: Cumin or any other favorite spices

## Prep

* Toast and grind spices
* Slice up the onions

## Cook

* put all of it in a pot, add water until you're at least 1" over the peas
* Bring heat to simmer
* Stir occasionally
* Cook until peas are mushy
* Remove dried chilis before serving

### Cooking notes

Keep a close eye on this, add water as it boils off. This stuff can ruin a pot if left to dry out on heat.
